# Crowdfunding Analysis 
Week 1 Challenge - UWA Data Analytics Course 

<b> Module 1 Challenge: Crowdfunding analysis <b> 

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.
